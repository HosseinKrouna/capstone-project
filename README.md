## Description

The Friends Wall App allows users to create events and add them to a list. Each event is accompanied by an image uploader, enabling users to upload images related to the event. Users can also edit and delete events according to their preferences. The app provides a convenient way to organize and coordinate events with friends and receive their responses through a voting system.
